    <h5>A summary of the contributions of each member for this project</h5>
    <br>

    <h3>Project Manager + (Developer & QA Member)</h3>
    <h4>Ker Ning Hui</h4>
    <p>
        Ning Hui was assigned the role of a Project Manager, along with being a developer and a QA member. Although
        she is the overall manager of this project, she was still required to carry out her duties as a developer
        and a QA member. As a developer, she was assigned the role of working on and coding out the Team Contributions
        page as instructed by the technical lead, while providing assistance to other developers. As a QA member, she 
        was assigned to work on the selenium and pytest codes and testing alongside the QA lead. Finally, as a project 
        manager, she was required to monitor the issues and step in whenever necessary. She oversees the overall project 
        movement and actions of her team members while giving certain instructions to the QA lead and technical lead when 
        the need arises and to keep the project moving.
    </p>

    <h3>QA Lead</h3>
    <h4>Koh Fang Ting</h4>
    <p>
        Fang Ting was assigned the role of a QA lead where she leads her QA members. In this team however, there is
        only one other QA member. Therefore, not only is she required to work on the testing just like a QA member,
        she also had to lead the other QA member in the team and provide clear instructions and tasks for that member
        to work on. She came up with the test cases and monitors the commits by the developers so that she can make
        changes to her test cases while raising issues whenever there are bugs found in the codes. She had to constantly
        update her test cases due to the frequent changes to the codes and ensured that her test cases matches with the
        most current codes. 
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Lead</h3>
    <h4>Lee Ze Rong</h4>
    <p>
        Ze Rong was assigned the role of a technical lead whereby he was in charge of the developers in this team.
        In addition to managing the developers under him, he was also required to carry out his duties as a developer.
        He was tasked to work on the To Do History page as well as helping out for the To Do page as one of the team's 
        developer could not make his codes work. He also constantly monitors the activities of his development team's 
        progress through github commits and manages the merging of the branches to the master branch to ensure that there
        are no conflicts before allowing a push request into it. This ensures that the website works as intended before 
        having the QA carry out tests on it.
    </p>

    <h3>Developer</h3>
    <h4>Jansen Ros</h4>
    <p>
        Jansen was assigned the role of a developer whereby he was required to code out certain parts of the
        project. He was given the task of developing the To Do page but was unable to get his codes working, which resulted
        in having some features of the page done by the team's technical lead instead. Despite the inability to produce a 
        functioning page, effort was still made to the best of his abilities. Therefore, the To Do page was completed
        due to the collaboration between Jansen and the technical lead. 
    </p>

    <h3>Developer</h3>
    <h4>Ray Tan</h4>
    <p>
        Ray was also assigned the role of a developer and was required to code out certain parts of the project. At the
        start of the project, he was required to work on coding out a simple code base (referencing from the video)
        which will later serve as the core to be further developed on. He was later on assigned to also work on the
        User Login page. Despite having a working page, there were many conflicts between the master branch and his own
        branch which resulted in the need for the technical lead to step in and make changes to ensure they can merge
        without any issues. Assistance from one other developer in the team was also requested.
